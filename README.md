# What I'm Craving

## Description 

As a food enthusiast, I want an app that will display recipes and restaurants for specific food items so that I can decide whether to make food or eat out by comparing the quality of both options.

This app is designed to provide the user with the best options to find the food that they crave through both top recipes and local restaurants. The user can search the type of food they are hungry for and the app will display recipes and restaurants that relate to this search. They will see the exact price of the recipe and the average price range of the restaurant. They will also see the quality of the restaurant which they can compare to the ingredients used in the recipe.

## Usage 

In order to access this application, the user can click on the link below to the home page of the website. From there they can use the navbar at the top to navigate the website.

* [What I'm Craving Web App](https://kreid333.github.io/project-1/)

From there, the user can select which type of cuisine they would like using the dropdown menu. After clicking search, the page will populate two cards, one containing recipes, and one containing restaurants. This will display name, rating, location of restaurant, time to make of recipe, price range of the restaurant, and images of both if provided. 

If the user wants to search for a new recipe and restaurant again under the same cuisine, all they have to do is press search again and the page will populate with new options. If they want to search a different cuisine, then they can choose a new one from the dropdown and press search. To clear the page, they can press the clear button, or refresh the page. 

Below is a image of how the page will look when the user selects a cuisine and presses search.
